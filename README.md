# Branding
A collection of branded assets to be used freely by anyone who needs them ðŸ™‚ These are in a variety of formats, primarily Adobe Illustrator .ai files along with .svg versions for maximum compatibility and where it makes sense, either .png or .jpg as well. If you want something that isn't already here, [get in touch](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/) and I'll do my best to accommodate. Conversely, if you make something awesome, please feel free to contribute it to this repo and send me a PR.

The assets are broken down into the following folders:

## [Logos and Icons](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Logos)
These are the fundamental basic logos in various formats, colours and styles. They include the stylised version of ';-- which is typically used as a simple representation of the brand. It's on social channels, the favicon of the website etc. Every other version of the logo we have is in there in one form or another.

## [Merch](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Merch)
This is *real* stuff - things you can actually hold in your hands! It includes:

### [3D Logos](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Merch/3D%20Prints)
These are .3mf files created for printing on a Prusa with Multi Material Upgrade (MMU) unit. We played around with a lot of different variants of how to print this and ultimately decided that face down on a smooth PEI steel sheet gave the best result.

### [Stickers](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Merch/Stickers)
Self-explanatory. You can either get these printed wherever you want or order them directly from [the HIBP Sticker Mule store](https://www.stickermule.com/au/haveibeenpwned)

## [Wallpapers](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Wallpapers/Full%20Logo%20on%20Gradient)
These can be used for either PC wallpapers or the hero image on social channels. They're presented here in lots of different dimensions to meet typical desktop sizes. Some of them are *very* wide, simply due to multi-monitor setups.

## [Special Use Cases](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Special%20Use%20Cases)
Lots of random bits and pieces made for specific purposes and possibly not relavent anywhere else, but they're all here anyway.
